ACES (Team 09) Project Repository for CPSC 5110 21FQ Fundamentals of Software Engineering

This is a website built off the [ASP.NET Tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Agile Methodologies,  related principles, and how they apply to a 4-person team developing a software project.

The ACES Team chose to make a restaurtant recommendation website for the Seattle area. The idea was for users to be able to find new restaurants based on cuisine type and user ratings
